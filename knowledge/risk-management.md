# Risk Management

Position sizing
- Risk 0.5–1.0% per trade.
- Use ATR-based stops; widen spread/volatility buffers on news.

Drawdown
- Hard daily loss limit: 2–3R or 2–3%.
- Stop trading for the day after limit hit.

Execution rules
- Avoid trading during first 5–10 minutes after high-impact events.
- Skip low-liquidity hours unless strategy is validated there.

Portfolio hygiene
- Cap correlated exposure (e.g., USD-heavy pairs).
- Weekly review: max adverse excursion, avg winner/loser, PF.
