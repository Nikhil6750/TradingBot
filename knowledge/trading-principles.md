# Trading Principles (Nikhil Reddy)
- Always define risk per trade (e.g., 0.5–1.0%).
- Only trade during allowed sessions (London/NY), avoid low-liquidity hours.
- Confirm entries with confluence: structure, momentum, and catalyst.
- Never trade during red-flag events unless system explicitly covers it.
