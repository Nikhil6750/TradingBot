# Economic Calendar FAQ

## What’s shown?
Today's events from Investing.com CSV: Time, Cur., Imp., Event, Actual, Forecast, Previous.

## How do I filter?
- In UI: use currency filter (e.g., USD) and “Upcoming only”.
- In chat: `events USD` shows upcoming USD events.

## How are times handled?
Times are read as HH:MM (local). “Upcoming only” hides past times.

## Trading around events
- High-impact events (NFP, CPI, rate decisions) can invalidate technicals.
- If open position exists, consider reducing risk or hedging ahead of red-flag events.
